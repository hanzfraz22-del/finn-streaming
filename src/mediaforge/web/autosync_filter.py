"""Per-job AutoSync episode/season filter helpers.

Filter JSON schema (stored in autosync_jobs.episode_filter, may be NULL):

    {
        "mode": "all" | "selected",
        "seasons": { "<season_number>": true | false | "1-12,15" },
        "include_movies": true | false
    }

Semantics
---------
* episode_filter is NULL / empty  -> no filtering at all.  This preserves the
  exact legacy behaviour: every numbered season is synced, while the
  ``are_movies`` collection (aniworld ``/filme``) stays excluded.  s.to specials
  live in ``staffel-0`` which is a normal numbered season and therefore keeps
  syncing as before.

* mode "all"      -> every season is included unless explicitly set to ``false``;
  brand new seasons that appear later are auto-included.
* mode "selected" -> only seasons present in the map are considered; a season set
  to ``true`` is fully included (incl. future episodes), a range string limits it
  to those episodes, ``false`` excludes it.  Seasons not listed are excluded, so
  entirely new seasons are NOT synced until the user opts them in.

Movies / specials (``are_movies`` collection) are controlled solely by
``include_movies`` and are never episode-filtered.

Used by: autosync_worker.py, which calls parse_filter() once per job and then
movie_included()/episode_included() per candidate item while syncing.
